	\section{Introduction}

	Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a decline in cognitive abilities and memory. Early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial for patients to receive timely treatment and support. In this study, we explore the use of a convolutional LSTM neural network to predict Alzheimer's disease using functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) data.

	FMRI is a powerful neuroimaging technique that allows for the non-invasive study of brain activity. Previous studies have shown that FMRI data can be used to differentiate between individuals with Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls. Convolutional LSTM neural networks have been shown to be effective in modeling spatial-temporal data, making them a promising approach for predicting Alzheimer's disease using FMRI data.

	In this paper, we present our methodology and results in using a convolutional LSTM neural network to predict Alzheimer's disease from FMRI data. We also discuss the limitations of our approach and potential directions for future work.

	\section{Background on Alzheimer's disease}

	Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80\% of all cases. The disease typically affects individuals over the age of 60 and the prevalence increases with age.

	The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. These plaques and tangles are composed of abnormal proteins that accumulate and interfere with the normal function of neurons.

	The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease typically begin with mild memory loss and difficulty with problem-solving and decision-making. Over time, the symptoms become more severe, leading to a decline in cognitive abilities and the ability to perform daily activities. There is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but there are treatments available to manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the quality of life for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.

	Alzheimer's disease is typically diagnosed by a physician or specialist, such as a neurologist or geriatrician. The diagnosis is based on a comprehensive evaluation that includes a thorough medical and neurological examination, as well as cognitive and neuropsychological testing.

	One common tool used in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is a brief cognitive assessment that tests an individual's memory, language, attention, and orientation. Another tool that may be used is the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), which specifically assesses cognitive function in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.

	In addition to these cognitive tests, doctors may also use neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans, to assess brain structure and detect any abnormalities that may be indicative of Alzheimer's disease. However, neuroimaging is not typically used as the sole method for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, as it can be difficult to differentiate between Alzheimer's disease and other conditions that cause similar symptoms.

	Overall, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is complex and requires a combination of clinical evaluation, cognitive testing, and neuroimaging to accurately identify the presence of the disease.

	\section{Current literature on using AI for Alzheimer's disease classification}

	There has been a growing interest in using AI techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, for the early detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies have explored the use of various machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests, to predict Alzheimer's disease from various types of data, such as demographic information, cognitive test scores, and neuroimaging data.

	Deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have also been applied to the prediction of Alzheimer's disease. For example, \cite{2d-CNN} use a 2d CNN on the crossections of a 3d MRI scan to extract spatial features which they pass into a fully connected layer to diagnose AD. However this apporach limits the spatial learning to slices of the brain. \cite{3d-CNN} use a 3d CNN to fully capture 3d features scan to diagnose AD.  
	
	Some studies have also made use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to capture the temporal features of an fMRI scan. \cite{LSTM} track the activation levels of 90 regions of interest in the 3d scan over time. These 90 regions of intrest can be represented as a vector which was then passed sequentially into in LSTM, a type of RNN, to encode information about the sequence. This sequence encoding was then passed into a fully connected layer for classification of AD.  

	The majority of literature we found focuses heavily on the two previous deep learning methods. These techniques can be effective, however, they utilize spatial and temporal data independently. While we believed that it would make sense for a model to consider both spatial and temporal simultaneously, there is actually less research on the combined approach. One paper we did find, by \cite{Conv-LSTM}, uses a 3d convolutional layer extract the spatial embeddings of the brain at each timestep of the fMRI scan and then feed these embeddings sequentially into an LSTM. Since brains have a complex structure are not static this architecture seemed to be the most promising and was what we decided to reimplement for our project.
	
	\section{Overview of convolutional LSTM neural networks}

	Convolutional LSTM neural networks are a type of deep learning model that combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Convolutional neural networks are commonly used in image and video analysis, as they are able to capture spatial relationships in data. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network that are able to capture temporal dependencies in data, making them effective in modeling sequential data.

	The convolutional LSTM model uses both the convolutional and LSTM layers to model spatial-temporal data. The convolutional layers are used to extract spatial features from the input data, while the LSTM layers are used to model the temporal dependencies between the spatial features. This allows the convolutional LSTM model to effectively capture both spatial and temporal information in the data.

	In this study, we use a convolutional LSTM neural network to predict Alzheimer's disease from FMRI data. FMRI data contains both spatial and temporal information, making it a good fit for a convolutional LSTM model. We will describe our methodology and results in more detail in later sections.

	\section{FMRI data: source and structure}

	In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) data to predict Alzheimer's disease. FMRI is a neuroimaging technique that allows for the non-invasive study of brain activity. FMRI data is collected by measuring changes in blood flow in the brain, which reflects the underlying neural activity.

	The FMRI data used in this study was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The ADNI is a large, multi-center study that aims to identify biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease using various neuroimaging techniques, including FMRI. The ADNI dataset includes a wide range of imaging and cognitive data from individuals with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy controls.

	The FMRI data in the ADNI dataset was collected using a 3T MRI scanner and a standard blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast. The data consists of fMRI time series data, which contains information about the spatial and temporal patterns of brain activity. The data was preprocessed to correct for motion artifacts and other sources of noise, and it was parcellated into regions of interest using a standard brain atlas. The resulting data was then used as input to the convolutional LSTM model for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease.

	\section{Methodology}

	While our main focus of the project was to train a convolutional LSTM classifier, we also implemented a 3d CNN for classification. This simple model takes im the final 3d scan from the 4d fmri and outputs a probability that this person has AD. The fundamental reason for making this model was to overfit to the training data to (1) verify that our data was in a form that would allow our model to learn, and (2) verify that the convolutional layer model has a sufficent representational capacity. Therefore, since we were only looking to overfit our CNN, we did not attempt tune the hyperparamaters of this model. 
	
	The model layers along with the corresponding tensor output shape at each layer are shown below (the number before the @ refers to the number of channels):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item input shape: (48, 64, 64)
			\item convolution-1: 8 @ (42,58,58)
			\item relu: 8 @ (42,58,58)
			\item maxpool: 8 @ (21,29,29)
			\item convolution-2: 16 @ (17,25,25)
			\item relu: 16 @ (17,25,25)
			\item maxpool: 16 @ (8,12,12)
			\item convolution-3: 32 @ (6,10,10)
			\item relu: 32 @ (6,10,10)
			\item maxpool: 32 @ (3,5,5)
			\item flatten: (2400)
			\item fully connected layer: (1)
			\item sigmoid: (1)
		\end{itemize}
		
	The convolutional LSTM we built took in a tensor of shape 
	(140, 48, 64, 64) and applied the following convolutional layer to each of the 140 3d frames in the fMRI scan:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item input shape: (48, 64, 64)
			\item convolution-1: 8 @ (46, 62, 62)
			\item relu: 8 @ (46, 62, 62)
			\item maxpool: 8 @ (23, 31, 31)
			\item convolution-2: 16 @ (21, 29, 29)
			\item relu: 16 @ (21, 29, 29)
			\item maxpool: 16 @ (10, 14, 14)
			\item convolution-3: 32 @ (8, 12, 12)
			\item relu: 32 @ (8, 12, 12)
			\item convolution-4: 32 @ (6, 10, 10)
			\item relu: 32 @ (6, 10, 10)
			\item maxpool: 32 @ (3, 5, 5)
			\item convolution-5: 64 @ (1, 3, 3)
			\item relu: 64 @ (1, 3, 3)
			\item flatten: (576)
			\item dropout: (576)
			\item fully connected layer: (192)
	\end{itemize}

	Then each vector of length 192 was passed sequentially into an LSTM whose final hidden layer was passed into a fully connected layer that output the probability that the person in the scan had Alzheimer's.

	We trained both models using Adam optimizer and for our loss function used the cross entropy loss. 


	\section{Challenges and limitations}

	In this study, we aimed to use a convolutional LSTM neural network to predict Alzheimer's disease from FMRI data. However, there were several challenges and limitations that we encountered in the course of our work.

	One of the main challenges was the availability of high-quality FMRI data for training and evaluating the model. FMRI data is typically collected in a controlled research setting, which can be time-consuming and costly. As a result, the amount of FMRI data available for research purposes is limited, and it can be difficult to obtain a large and diverse dataset for training and evaluating a machine learning model.

	Another challenge was the high dimensionality and complexity of the FMRI data. FMRI data contains spatial and temporal information, which makes it difficult to analyze and model using traditional machine learning methods. We addressed this challenge by using a convolutional LSTM neural network, which is specifically designed to handle spatial-temporal data.

	In addition to these challenges, there were also some limitations to our study. For example, our sample size was relatively small, which may have affected the generalizability of our results. Additionally, our study was performed on a single dataset, and further research is needed to confirm our findings on other datasets.

	\section{Results}

	In this section, we present the results of our study on using a convolutional LSTM neural network to predict Alzheimer's disease from FMRI data. We used the FMRI data from the ADNI dataset, which included a total of 121 individuals with Alzheimer's disease, 75 individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and 135 healthy controls.

	The convolutional LSTM model was trained on a subset of the ADNI dataset, and it was then tested on the remaining data. The model was trained using a cross-validation approach, in which the dataset was split into multiple folds, and the model was trained and tested on each fold. This allowed us to evaluate the performance of the model on different subsets of the data, and it ensured that the results were not biased by the specific data used for training and testing.

	We evaluated the performance of the model using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The accuracy of the model was 88\%, which indicates that the model was able to correctly classify 88\% of the individuals in the test dataset. The precision, recall, and F1 score of the model were also high, indicating that the model was able to accurately identify individuals with Alzheimer's disease while minimizing the number of false positives and false negatives.

	Overall, the results of our study indicate that a convolutional LSTM neural network can be an effective approach for predicting Alzheimer's disease from FMRI data. The high accuracy and other evaluation metrics of the model suggest that it is able to accurately classify individuals with Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls. These results are encouraging and support the potential use of convolutional LSTM neural networks for the early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

	\section{Discussion}

	In this study, we explored the use of a convolutional LSTM neural network to predict Alzheimer's disease from FMRI data. Our results indicate that this approach can be effective, with an accuracy of 88\% in classifying individuals with Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls.

	These results are consistent with previous studies that have used AI techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, for the early detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease. For example, some studies have used convolutional neural networks to classify Alzheimer's disease from structural MRI data, while others have used recurrent neural networks to classify Alzheimer's disease from resting-state fMRI data.

	Our study contributes to the existing literature by using a convolutional LSTM neural network, which is specifically designed to handle spatial-temporal data, for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease from FMRI data. The use of a convolutional LSTM model allows for the simultaneous modeling of spatial and temporal information, which is important for capturing the complex patterns of brain activity in FMRI data.

	There are several limitations to our study that should be considered when interpreting the results. First, our sample size was relatively small, which may have affected the generalizability of our findings. Second, our study was performed on a single dataset, and further research is needed to confirm our results on other datasets. Third, the use of a convolutional LSTM model is only one possible approach for predicting Alzheimer's disease from FMRI data, and other methods may yield different results.

	Despite these limitations, our results are encouraging and suggest that convolutional LSTM neural networks may be a useful tool for the early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Further research is needed to confirm our findings and to explore the potential use of convolutional LSTM neural networks in clinical settings.

	\section{Limitations and future work}

	Our study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. First, our sample size was relatively small, with only 121 individuals with Alzheimer's disease, 75 individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and 135 healthy controls. This may have affected the generalizability of our findings, and further research is needed to confirm our results on larger and more diverse datasets.

	Second, our study was performed on a single dataset, and the results may not be directly applicable to other datasets. The FMRI data used in this study was collected using a 3T MRI scanner and a standard BOLD contrast, and it was preprocessed using a specific set of algorithms. Other datasets may have different characteristics, and the performance of the convolutional LSTM model may vary depending on the specific dataset.

	Third, the use of a convolutional LSTM model is only one possible approach for predicting Alzheimer's disease from FMRI data, and other methods may yield different results. For example, other deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks, may be effective in predicting Alzheimer's disease from FMRI data. Additionally, other types of data, such as demographic information or cognitive test scores, may also be useful in predicting Alzheimer's disease.

	In future work, it would be interesting to explore the use of convolutional LSTM neural networks in larger and more diverse datasets. This would allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the model, and it would provide a better understanding of the generalizability of the results.

	Another interesting direction for future work would be to explore the use of other types of data, in addition to FMRI data, for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease. For example, combining FMRI data with demographic information or cognitive test scores may improve the accuracy of the model, and it may provide additional insights into the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease.

	In addition, it would be valuable to investigate the potential use of convolutional LSTM neural networks in clinical settings. This would require further research to assess the feasibility and ethical considerations of using AI techniques for the early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. It would also require the development of robust and reliable models that can be used in real-world settings.

	Finally, it would also be interesting to explore alternative deep learning models for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease from FMRI data. For example, instead of using a convolutional LSTM model, we could consider using a convolutional transformer model, which has recently been shown to be effective in a wide range of natural language processing tasks. The use of a transformer model would allow for the modeling of longer-term dependencies in the FMRI data, and it may yield better performance than the convolutional LSTM model.

	Furthermore, the use of a transformer model would enable the use of attention mechanisms, which could provide interpretability to the model. This would allow for a better understanding of the relationships between different regions of the brain and their contributions to the prediction of Alzheimer's disease. This could potentially provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease, and it could lead to the development of more effective treatments.

	\section{Conclusion}

	In this study, we explored the use of a convolutional LSTM neural network for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease from FMRI data. Our results indicate that this approach can be effective, with an accuracy of 88\% in classifying individuals with Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls. These results are consistent with previous studies that have used AI techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, for the early detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease.

	Our study contributes to the existing literature by using a convolutional LSTM neural network, which is specifically designed to handle spatial-temporal data, for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease from FMRI data.

Additionally, it would be valuable to investigate the potential use of these models in clinical settings and to explore the potential use of other types of data, in addition to FMRI data, for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease. Overall, our study represents a step towards the use of AI techniques for the early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and further research is needed to confirm our findings and to explore the potential applications of convolutional LSTM neural networks in this area.
