	\section{Introduction}
	The current standard for diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease requires significant time and resources. According to \cite[Mayo Clinic]{alz_desc}, doctors perform a physical exam, neurological exam, and cognitive tests to 
	"judge functional abilities and identify behavioral changes." Included in this process is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain which produces a detailed view of the brain's structure in the form of images.
	Our goal is to train a deep neural network to identify underlying structures in the brain from MRI images and use this information to diagnose Alzheimer's Disease in a wide-variety of patients. If successful, we would develop a highly-competent model that would significantly reduce the time and cost of diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease. Using our model, we will build a web application that allows medical professionals to upload  
	MRI images and receive an output classification which they can use to make a better informed decision on a patient's diagnosis.

	\section{Approach}
	The first major hurdle with any machine learning problem is finding a suitable dataset. Fortunately, we found a dataset with approximately 5,000 images of brain MRIs with annotations indicating the severity of a patient's Alzheimer's Disease \citep{kaggle_dset}. Although we feel that this dataset will be sufficient for our purposes, we have also applied for access to some larger datasets that may help us develop a more robust model.

	Given that we already have an annotated dataset, the next step is analyzing the data and building an appropriate model architecture.
	\textbf{JACOB THIS IS WHERE YOU WRITE STUFF. I need you to write paragraphs for bullets 5 and 6 on the instructions}

	Once we have a working model, we will build a web application using TypeScript and React which will allow medical professionals to upload MRI images and receive a diagnosis. Upon upload, these images will be sent to a Python backend which will perform inference using the model. The backend will then return the classification to the frontend which will display it to the user.

	\section{Timeline}
	We will be meeting at least once a week until the final presentation to discuss our progress, plan for the next week, and work on any upcoming deadlines. Our tentative timeline is as follows:
